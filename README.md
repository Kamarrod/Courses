# Courses
First ASP.NET MVC app. This is a simple online course application where users can create and take courses. The courses are designed to be completed by answering questions, which are checked using ChatGPT. When a user submits an answer, the system sends a request to ChatGPT to compare the user's response with the author's answer. This allows for a seamless and efficient learning experience. With this application, users can easily create and share their own courses, while also taking advantage of the courses created by others. Whether you're a student or a teacher, this platform is perfect for anyone looking to expand their knowledge and skills.
